====================++ Database Alteration Article ++===================#
																		|
Date of registration: 29/04/2019										|

Summary:																|
	In order to be able to get time sensitive statistics				|
	from tables in the main database, we announce the alteration 		|
	of the costumers and products tables.								|
																		|
Concept:																|
	To those tables will be added one extra column called				|
	creationDate, witch will contain the dumps of a datetime.date		|
	object containing the date of insertion of the particular row.		|
	The idea is to have the statistics page create datetime.timedelta	|
	objects in order to determine each entry's period of creation.		|
																		|
Execution Plan:															|
	In order to fully implement the alterations, changes in the 		|
	new_product() and new_costumer() functions will have to be made.	|
																		|
	There might be some lines of code in the Sell, Costumers or Products|
	page. If so, there will be the need to change that as well.			|
